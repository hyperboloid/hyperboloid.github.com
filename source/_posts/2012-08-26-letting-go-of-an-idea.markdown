I had lived in Los Angeles my whole life, and I
had always yearned to go to Silicon Valley, which I envisioned as a mecca
bustling with entrepreneurs inventing the future and investors tuning out
overly-enthusiastic elevator pitches. So earlier this year I bookmarked the
[Hacker's Guide to Silicon Valley](http://steveblank.com/visitors-guide/)
on my phone, rented a room in the heart of the mission district in San Francisco,
and set out on a mission to change the world with my new idea.

I got the sense that all of the startup action was taking
place in SOMA, so I rented an office in a coworking space there. I
saw that there was a [Hackers and Founders](http://www.hackersandfounders.com/)
meeting in the evening, and I was incredibly excited to meet my future
cofounder. I quickly realized that even though everybody WAS looking for a cofounder,
everyone already had an idea they wanted to work on. Nobody wanted a cofounder
who already had an idea.

So I pressed on, determined to have my idea see the light of day one way or
another.

After a couple weeks of networking I started to develop a secret wish that I would
run into someone working on exactly the same idea, and that we would make a
perfect team. But as an unconnected valley outsider, the odds of this happening
to me were basically 0. I had to convince someone.

After a couple of **months** of networking, I started to feel mental
anguish. Constantly pitching my idea to other people started to feel
laborious. I began to feel like one of those crazy inventors peddling some
useless junk. And all of the buzz about the upcoming Facebook IPO made me
wonder if I could just do it all alone, like the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg
in The Social Network.

People say that entrepreneurs never give up, that they exercise great mental
willpower to continue, and then eventually succeeded. The notion of a single
person facing insurmountable odds is romanticised by Hollywood, and I'm sure
everyone identifies with them at some point. But this is unrealistic. Nobody
should expect to be able to figure out an end-to-end business model all by
themselves. And having a great team to ideate with and share the burden is way
more important than whatever idea you're currently working on. You need be
flexible, and find partners who are flexible. And it's way faster to convince
everyone else in the valley your idea is solid with social proof than building
and marketing an MVP all by yourself.

Oh, and losing a cofounder starts the entire process all over again.
