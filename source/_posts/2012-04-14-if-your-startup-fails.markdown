I was talking to my friend the other day, and we both agreed that if we had
to decide between hiring an employee who has worked at a wildly successful
company, or one that failed, we would choose the one that worked at the company
that failed.

Depending on the amount of funding, companies that fail can make a lot of mistakes.
And most companies do fail, so this is probably the greatest upside to working at a
startup that doesn't make it. It's unlikely anyone will realize what the mistakes are
at the time, but the benefit comes from hindsight. Employees at a company that fails
have likely spent years of their lives helping to build a product that ultimately will
not provide any value to society, so they naturally spend a lot of time analyzing every
decision the company made.

And this is why it's great to work at a company that failed. There are so many reasons
why a company might fail, and it's a valuable thing to have many different perspectives
on how to avoid failure inside future companies.
