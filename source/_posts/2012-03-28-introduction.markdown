I have decided to finally start a blog. It's taken me a while, mostly because
I always have a hard time reading other people's [out](
http://blogsofnote.blogspot.com)-[of](http://wordpress.com)-[the](
http://livejournal.com)-[box](http://tumblr.com) blogs. The designs are too 
busy. I wanted something clean, something I could customize, something free.
I finally found it.

This blog is hosted at [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), using the built-in
support for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki)
and an added [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) layer. I'm using the [theme](
https://github.com/ivanjovanovic/ji-octopress-theme) Ivan Jovanovic is using for his
[blog](http://ivanjovanovic.com/).

The hardest part is out of the way, so let me set out the purpose of this blog.
When I started college, I knew nothing about tech. I didn't know about linux
distributions or git or current trends, and I didn't know how to find out.
Even after graduating, I still knew nothing and only landed my first fulltime
job 10 months after graduating. Luckily, I became employee #20 at a startup
in Santa Monica, and it changed everything. Working there was one of the best
experiences of my life, and taught me so many things. So this blog is about my
experiences in the world of tech startups.
