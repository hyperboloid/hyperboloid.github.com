I started feeling the itch to strike out on my own the in summer of 2011. I was
working as a software engineer, and my roommate was an excellent product manager.
[YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com/) was getting tons of attention, especially
with the [$150k deal](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/28/yuri-milner-sv-angel-offer-every-new-y-combinator-startup-150k/).

We thought, "Hey, we make a perfect team! Let's come up with an idea
and apply to YC W12. If we get accepted, we'll quit our jobs".

So we spent weeks thinking really hard about how to solve the world's problems,
how to solve our own problems, how to address the [RFSs](http://ycombinator.com/rfs.html).
We ended up figuring out a real problem that needed solving, a problem we also had,
and a plausible way of solving that problem. However, we got rejected and that ultimately killed
the partnership.

Like I've mentioned before, failure makes you perform a thorough examination of
what went wrong. Obviously, we hardly started so there were lot of things we were
missing. But I think the primary reason was that we underestimated how important
it was to have an extensive understanding of the domain in which our company would operate.

If the time is really ripe for your company, there should be a long list of
companies that have already tried and failed to do every possible variation
of your idea. I have found that [Crunchbase](http://www.crunchbase.com/) and
[Quora](http://quora.com/) are excellent places to find deadpooled companies and
learn why solving the problem is so difficult. It is with this knowledge that you'll
be able to come up with a really excellent idea. One that will survive many
rejection emails, and drive the founders to press on anyways.

And getting this understanding takes a **long time**. Lots and lots of **research**
and **asking people** about your company's domain.
