	<h1 class="title">Advertising Models</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>In today&#8217;s age, the idea that a business can offer a product for a reduced price by subsidizing the cost with advertisements is quite prevalent. But where did this business model originate?</p>

<p>It turns out the first large-scale use of this business model was introduced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Day_(publisher)">Benjamin Day</a> with the introduction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_press">penny press</a>.<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup> He reduced the cost of a newspaper from 6 cents to a penny, and printed at the top of every page, &#8220;The object of this paper is to lay before the public, at a price within the means of every one, all the news of the day, and at the same time offer an advantageous medium for advertisements.&#8221; This resulted in quite a remarkable change in the distribution of information, and has sustained newspapers successfully for many decades.</p>

<p>One important drawback when relying on advertising is that it inevitably decreases during a recession. This most recent recession saw a 50% cut in ad revenue for newspapers, and because of the prevalence of online display advertising, it seems that this model will never recover.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s look at online advertising models. Initially, a successful online ad was measured in pageviews, mirroring the print advertising model. There have been some improvements in terms of analytics, but from my perspective online advertising has not yet significantly changed the efficacy of advertising. It has simply reduced the cost of an advertisement without significantly increasing the volume, which is why it has been so detrimental to publishers relying on a percentage of the adspend.</p>

<p>I argue that as the economy recovers, we will see a growing gap between the amount of money an advertiser was spending on traditional print ads and the amount of money spent on online display ads. This will leave a large margin (almost 50%) for experimental adspend. We have already seen this with the widely available Groupon campaigns.</p>

<p>This new advertising model is still very much up for grabs, but I believe the winner will utilize all the new data being collected about the consumer, and pair them better than ever with advertisers. With the ubiquity of mobile devices, I don&#8217;t believe display advertising is going to be viable for much longer, even digitally.</p>

<p>So what is the solution? I&#8217;ve just mentioned that there will be a large surplus
of adspend in near future &#8211; so why not spend it directly on the consumer? I believe that the best utilization of this surplus is to offer FREE goods and services to consumers for both customer acquisition and retention. The company that can most effectively distribute these goods and services will steal the online ad market from today&#8217;s players. This means predicting the cost of a acquision for individual customers, their cost of retention, and their ability to bring new customers on board through word of mouth. This is a tall order, and will require the joint effort of people from many disparate disciplines. Groupon very nearly had the right idea, but unfortunately they were missing the biggest piece of the puzzle &#8211; proper targeting.</p>

<p>What this means for the newspapers is that the adspend is not coming back. They will need to find a way to distribute their content more efficiently than ever before.</p>

<p><sup id="fn-1">1</sup><sub>Some credit should be awarded to Horatio David Shepard for envisioning a penny press, but it was Benjamin Day who ultimately commercialized it successfully with advertisement. Shepard&#8217;s penny press failed within 3 weeks because it simply relied upon economies of scale. <a href="#fnref-1"> &#8617;</a></sub></p>
