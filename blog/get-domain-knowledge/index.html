	<div class="entry-content"><p>I started feeling the itch to strike out on my own the in summer of 2011. I was
working as a software engineer, and my roommate was an excellent product manager.
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> was getting tons of attention, especially
with the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/28/yuri-milner-sv-angel-offer-every-new-y-combinator-startup-150k/">$150k deal</a>.</p>

<p>We thought, &#8220;Hey, we make a perfect team! Let&#8217;s come up with an idea
and apply to YC W12. If we get accepted, we&#8217;ll quit our jobs&#8221;.</p>

<p>So we spent weeks thinking really hard about how to solve the world&#8217;s problems,
how to solve our own problems, how to address the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs.html">RFSs</a>.
We ended up figuring out a real problem that needed solving, a problem we also had,
and a plausible way of solving that problem. However, we got rejected and that ultimately killed
the partnership.</p>

<p>Like I&#8217;ve mentioned before, failure makes you perform a thorough examination of
what went wrong. Obviously, we hardly started so there were lot of things we were
missing. But I think the primary reason was that we underestimated how important
it was to have an extensive understanding of the domain in which our company would operate.</p>

<p>If the time is really ripe for your company, there should be a long list of
companies that have already tried and failed to do every possible variation
of your idea. I have found that <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a> and
<a href="http://quora.com/">Quora</a> are excellent places to find deadpooled companies and
learn why solving the problem is so difficult. It is with this knowledge that you&#8217;ll
be able to come up with a really excellent idea. One that will survive many
rejection emails, and drive the founders to press on anyways.</p>

<p>And getting this understanding takes a <strong>long time</strong>. Lots and lots of <strong>research</strong>
and <strong>asking people</strong> about your company&#8217;s domain.</p>
