	<h1 class="title">Letting Go of an Idea</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>I had lived in Los Angeles my whole life, and I
had always yearned to go to Silicon Valley, which I envisioned as a mecca
bustling with entrepreneurs inventing the future and investors tuning out
overly-enthusiastic elevator pitches. So earlier this year I bookmarked the
<a href="http://steveblank.com/visitors-guide/">Hacker&#8217;s Guide to Silicon Valley</a>
on my phone, rented a room in the heart of the mission district in San Francisco,
and set out on a mission to change the world with my new idea.</p>

<p>I got the sense that all of the startup action was taking
place in SOMA, so I rented an office in a coworking space there. I
saw that there was a <a href="http://www.hackersandfounders.com/">Hackers and Founders</a>
meeting in the evening, and I was incredibly excited to meet my future
cofounder. I quickly realized that even though everybody WAS looking for a cofounder,
everyone already had an idea they wanted to work on. Nobody wanted a cofounder
who already had an idea.</p>

<p>So I pressed on, determined to have my idea see the light of day one way or
another.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks of networking I started to develop a secret wish that I would
run into someone working on exactly the same idea, and that we would make a
perfect team. But as an unconnected valley outsider, the odds of this happening
to me were basically 0. I had to convince someone.</p>

<p>After a couple of <strong>months</strong> of networking, I started to feel mental
anguish. Constantly pitching my idea to other people started to feel
laborious. I began to feel like one of those crazy inventors peddling some
useless junk. And all of the buzz about the upcoming Facebook IPO made me
wonder if I could just do it all alone, like the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg
in The Social Network.</p>

<p>People say that entrepreneurs never give up, that they exercise great mental
willpower to continue, and then eventually succeeded. The notion of a single
person facing insurmountable odds is romanticised by Hollywood, and I&#8217;m sure
everyone identifies with them at some point. But this is unrealistic. Nobody
should expect to be able to figure out an end-to-end business model all by
themselves. And having a great team to ideate with and share the burden is way
more important than whatever idea you&#8217;re currently working on. You need be
flexible, and find partners who are flexible. And it&#8217;s way faster to convince
everyone else in the valley your idea is solid with social proof than building
and marketing an MVP all by yourself.</p>

<p>Oh, and losing a cofounder starts the entire process all over again.</p>
